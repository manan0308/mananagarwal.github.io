>2022 has been a rollercoaster of a year that went on going up professionally and down personally, but such is life. You win some, you lose some.

# 🏆 Good things that happened in 2022

## ⚠️🚨 This list has a lot of survivorship bias. Tread with caution!

### 1. Graduated with a Mechatronics (robotics) engineering degree from Manipal.
_Feels good to have an engineering degree in a field that is a bit niche. However, I practically don’t remember most of it, thanks to an online college_
### 2. Started a full-time product management job at Razorpay as an APM.
_I joined Razorpay full-time on 3rd Jan 2021(the first working day of 2021), and it has been an insanely fulfilling year at work._

_The amount of learning I have had on PMing and how scaled startups operate is insane, and I am so grateful I decided to go down this route._

_In my second year, I used to tell a friend that there was no way I could get here because they just don’t hire APMs off-campus. From there to today, quite a journey_
    
### 3. Got promoted to PM - 1 in my first review cycle.
    
_I was fortunate enough to pick up projects, which, combined with a kickass team and outstanding mentorship, resulted in a high impact across the board._ 
_A promotion is an outcome but seeing your efforts get recognized gratifying._
    
### 4. Moved to Bangalore and started living all by myself.
    
_This is probably up there and more significant than achievements at work, but living alone in a new city was a considerable achievement._
_It taught me a lot of things (mom, if you are reading this, yes, I miss home, and yes, it’s hard to live alone 🙄)_
    
### 5. Really understood money management, taxes, and personal finance.
    
_One of the upsides of building a payroll and taxation product in India is that you can recite most taxation laws in your sleep at 2:30 am._ 
_This year I learned about harnessing the power of credit cards(sorry, dad, that one extra card is needed for miles), investing, and spending money._
_I made my share of splurges (that Call of Duty for 5k is worth it, ok) but did reasonably well overall._
    
### 6. Hit 10k followers on Twitter.
    
_It was not something I optimized for, but the milestone did feel good, and it became a big dopamine rush when I was in the late 9 thousand._
