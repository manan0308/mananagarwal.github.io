Currently, I work as a Strategy Manager in the group-level strategy and special projects team at Reliance Retail. We operate out of the Retail CEO’s office and spend our time identifying and driving high-impact, cross-business initiatives across Reliance Retail’s many business verticals, ranging from grocery and electronics to fashion & lifestyle, beauty, luxury brands, and much more. Reliance Retail is India’s largest retailer, most recently valued at ~USD 100 billion.

Before this, I spent a good chunk of my life in the Indian startup ecosystem. I’ve worked at companies like Razorpay (fintech, last valued at USD 7.5 billion) and Bounce (mobility, last valued at USD 500 million).

At Razorpay, I was the youngest-ever PM hire and spent over two years building and scaling RazorpayX Payroll — a B2B SaaS product for HR and payroll used by Indian companies. I loved every bit of it and now proudly consider myself a self-proclaimed taxation and payroll nerd (yes, that’s a thing).

I graduated with a degree in Robotics Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology. In college, I led the Business & PR team at Manipal's largest student-run media organization, [Manipal The Talk Network](https://www.instagram.com/manipalthetalk), and spent a disproportionate amount of time with the team at [Mars Rover Manipal](https://www.youtube.com/@MarsRoverManipal), building mars rovers that were far cooler than my GPA suggested.

When I'm not working, you'll usually find me building LEGO sets (25 sets, ~30,000 parts, and yes, there's an Excel tracker), flying planes on my flight simulator setup, or on an ongoing—and very serious quest to find the best vada pav in town.
