I'm a 23-year-old professional based in Mumbai, India.

Currently, I work as a Strategy Manager in the group-level strategy and special projects team at Reliance Retail. My team operates out of the Retail CEO's office and is responsible for identifying and driving key organizational initiatives across our multiple business lines, including grocery, electronics, fashion, and lifestyle. Reliance Retail is India's largest retailer, last valued at USD 100 billion.

Prior to my current role, I spent significant time in the Indian startup ecosystem at companies like Razorpay, a fintech giant valued at USD 7.5 billion, and Bounce, a mobility startup last valued at USD 500 million.

At Razorpay, I was the youngest-ever PM hire and spent over two years building and scaling RazorpayX Payroll, a B2B SaaS focused on HR and payroll for Indian companies. I thoroughly enjoyed the process and now consider myself a self-proclaimed taxation and payroll expert.

I graduated with a degree in robotics engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology. During my college years, I led the Business and Public Relations team at Manipal’s largest media organization, [Manipal The Talk Network](https://www.manipalthetalk.org/), and spent a significant amount of time contributing to our Mars Rover team at [Mars Rover Manipal](http://marsrovermanipal.com/).

When I'm not working, you'll likely find me building complex LEGO sets, flying planes on my flight simulator setup, or on a quest to find the best vada pav in town.
