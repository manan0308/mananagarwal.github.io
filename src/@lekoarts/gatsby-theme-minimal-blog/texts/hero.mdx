# 👋 Hi, I’m Manan Agarwal, based in Mumbai, India.

- I am mostly active on Twitter: [Manan Agarwal](https://x.com/manan_0308).

- Outside of work, I spend a lot of time tinkering with the latest AI models—using them to maximise personal productivity, experiment with bottom-up stock picking, and generally explore what’s possible when you put good models to work on real problems. A fair bit of AI stuff on the side, in short.

- When I’m not doing that, you’ll usually find me building unnecessarily complex LEGO sets, like [this one] (https://x.com/manan_0308/status/1789583024352280918) or [this one](https://x.com/manan_0308/status/1787076238395547863) or [THIS ONE](https://x.com/manan_0308/status/1784570914455404599) when I am not doom-scrolling Instagram

- I’m always up to chat about early careers in tech, product management, strategy as a function, India consumer businesses, quick commerce, and anything technology and AI.
