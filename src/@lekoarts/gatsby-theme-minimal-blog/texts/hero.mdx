# Hey, I'm Manan Agarwal.

- I'm mostly found lurking and occasionally tweeting on [Twitter](https://x.com/manan_0308).

- Outside of work, I spend a lot of time tinkering with the latest AI models, using them to maximise personal productivity, experiment with bottom-up stock picking, and generally explore what's possible when you put good models to work on real problems. A fair bit of AI stuff on the side, in short. *Graveyard section coming soon on this website with all my vibe coding quests and ideas.*

- When I'm not doing that, you'll usually find me building unnecessarily complex LEGO sets. You can check out my entire collection at [Lego Land](/lego).

> Always up to chat around a lot of themes: navigating early careers in tech, product management, personal finance, consumer strategy, AI and many more things!
